INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================

Have a server with:
	- Apache 2.2 ( with mod_rewrite )
	- PHP 5.3	 ( ensure you can see phpinfo(), 5.5 to use bcrypt ) 
	- MySql 5.5  ( ensure you can create and manage a database )

Prepare a htdocs folder on your server that can be accessed with a browser. Maybe you have to modify the virtualhost file on your server.

Uncompress source files from github into that folder (you dont need to have the /db and /doc folders published)

Execute the scripts on the `db` folder. goteo.sql first then the others. Not mention you have to create the database and a user for it.
IMPORTANT: better to replace SiteName and SiteMail with your site name/mail BEFORE execute the script texts.sql
Note that you have to write your own terms and privacy pages, those contents are empty at pages.sql

Go to http://your.intallation.site and you will see a settings file example, copy it into a file called `local-settings.php`.
Modify it with database credentials:
	· GOTEO_DB_SCHEMA is the name of your database
	· GOTEO_DB_USERNAME is the user you created for your database
	· GOTEO_DB_PASSWORD is the password you setted for that user

Modify the access point to the site
	· SITE_URL is 'http://your.intallation.site'
	· SRC_URL is (for you and now) the same 'http://your.intallation.site'
	· SEC_URL (if you have SSL certificate installed) is 'https://your.intallation.site'  (same otherwise)
* If you're installing on localhost you have to create a hosts entry for this
* if you want to install on a folder go hack the dispatcher /index.php

Every thing should be working fine at http://your.intallation.site 
* check that you have the .htaccess file (if downloaded the zip maybe not extracted) https://github.com/Goteo/Goteo/blob/master/.htaccess

Modify all others configuration constants at will
The PayPal implementation needs to be setup at library/paypal/config.php  (some day it will be merged into regular settings)

Login with user "root" and password "root" (no quotes both).
Go `http://your.intallation.site/admin/users/edit/root` to change the password and email
Try login with that password and manage the contents at http://your.intallation.site/admin
	
	
If you want to modify the code for your own purposses, better you read /doc/plataforma_goteo.doc (english version in progress)
Also remember that you have to license the modified source code and, recomended, publish a fork on github

We'll be thankful if you notify us about your implementation.


Notes
-----
Github user 'blackhold' did a very good sideline guide.
Check it out at  http://blackhold.nusepas.com/2012/07/instalar-plataforma-goteo-en-nuestro-server/
EXCEPT: password encription is now SHA1 with SALT.
It can be updated to "root" (no quotes) with the following sql statement:
UPDATE `user` SET password = '$1$L0HUgg5m$BFHWQWxOD/L3ekMBEIMVU.' WHERE id = 'root';

Do not leave empty password if your php is under 5.3.5
